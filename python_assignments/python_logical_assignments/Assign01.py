#Search online for the Python documentation for the len() function. It will be on a web page titled 
#“Built-in Functions.” Skim the list of other functions Python has, look up what the round() function does,
#and experiment with it in the interactive shell.
#Look up the round() and abs() functions on the Internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them
#in the interactive shell.

#length of list
List = [ 1, 2 , 3, 4 ]
print(len(List))

#round the value
print(round(2.9))
print(round(4.2))

#absolute value
print(abs(20))
print(abs(-40))
